			<h3>OUR VISION</h3>
			<img src="eco-farm.jpg"">
			<p> We belive that a great day starts with a great breakfast. And a great breakfast, in our opinion, consists of wholesome raw ingredients from environmentally friendly farmers. We found it hard to find a pre-packaged muesli that was just right – it was always missing something or included an ingredient we didn’t particularly like. Everybody is different, and we wanted to make sure everyone could enjoy their perfect brekkie every day, by creating their own custom muesli.</p>

			<p>We firmly believe that breakfast is the most important meal of the day – and a healthy breakfast should be accessible to all. However, when people try and make healthy choices, they are unaware that most foods, including kids cereals, contain processed sugar and preservatives. We wanted to create a way for consumers to choose 100% natural ingredients, with no chemicals, for a healthier muesli.</p>
